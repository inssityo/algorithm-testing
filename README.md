# algorithm-testing
Small sandbox application for testing similarity algorithms to rank objects by similarities of their values with equal keys.
Some possibly suitable pre-existing options (such as the Jaccard algorithm) will be tested. If a suitable algorithm is not found, a custom one will be written. 
The final product will then be implemented into the main project to sort potential roommates based on similarity to the user's preferred roommate's characteristics.
